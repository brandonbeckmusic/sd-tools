# sd-tools is a repository for my Software Development Tools project for the TripleTen Data Science program.
# I am supposed to be creating a webb app to help users interact and display data from a car advertisement dataset. 
# Everything seems a little overwhelming in terms of the completion of this project. 
# But I am just going to move step by step and break down sections into smaller goals.
# I'll look up whatever I don't understand. 
# I will go back and review the material.
# I will ask questions to the Discord server. 
# I'm not supposed to know everything right now. 
# Doing this, and remembering that, I just might survive.
